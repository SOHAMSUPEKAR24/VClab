      <h2>Emergency Guidelines</h2>
      <p>In any chemistry laboratory, safety is paramount. It’s essential to understand safety procedures and emergency responses. Our virtual lab includes guidelines on handling materials safely and what to do in emergencies.</p>
      <div class="emergency-guidelines">
        <h3>General Emergency Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fire:</strong> If you notice a fire, immediately press the fire alarm and evacuate the area. Use a fire extinguisher for small fires, but do not attempt to fight large fires. </li>
          <li><strong>Chemical Spills:</strong> In case of chemical spills, use appropriate spill kits or absorbent materials to contain and neutralize the spill. Notify staff or your supervisor immediately.</li>
          <li><strong>Inhalation of Chemicals:</strong> If you inhale dangerous fumes, leave the area immediately and move to fresh air. If symptoms persist, seek medical attention.</li>
          <li><strong>Eye Exposure:</strong> If chemicals get into your eyes, immediately flush with water for at least 15 minutes. Seek medical help if irritation continues.</li>
          <li><strong>Ingestion of Chemicals:</strong> If a chemical is ingested, immediately follow the instructions on the product label and contact a medical professional or poison control.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Emergency Contacts</h3>
